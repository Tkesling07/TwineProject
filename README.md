## Artists Statement
This project was made by me to learn the fundamentals of the Twine program. However, I also wanted to experiment with games taking place in a single area but with different times. I think its a pretty good way to save on a large amount of "Physical space" in your game while still being able to create interesting and long stories that can fill the time for games. This game takes place in a hotel, but the catch is that your interacting with it over multiple different times. The game revolves around the fate of the character you play as, which all happen inside the hotel. The only difference is where you are in the hotel at a specific time. It also experiments with multiple different ending that require the player to do some in depth searching for the good ending. I also wanted to keep the story a bit sparse and mysterious, partly since I wouldn't have to spend so much time developing a story, and because I think it makes the world of the game so more interesting
